It's a compiler that compiles C++!
## Why is there a G++ Binaries?
To compile a SourceDEFUN mod without compiling G++ every time. Efficient!
## G++ Information
This version is not recent, but is 4.4.7 compiled for Ubuntu (DEB amd64). Taken from /ubuntu/pool/universe/g/gcc-4.4/. Hashes may not be the same because i renamed them to shorthen the names.
## Why is it 4.4?

## This file exists because you can't create fo-
yup.

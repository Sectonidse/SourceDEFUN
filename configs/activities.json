  "But how to work with it you say? Here's how:                                                   ",
  "  1. Every named key dictionary is a prefix for some activity.                                 ",
  "     1.1. Do you see dictionary ACT with array RUN and value AIM?                              ",
  "     1.2. Well if we combine the path, we get: 'ACT_RUN_AIM!'                                  ",
  "     1.3. Then this 'ACT_RUN_AIM' gets registered by ai_activity.cpp [we'll call it reader]    ",
  "  2. Why is there a 0 in keys?                                                                 ",
  "     2.1. It's there for a reason. It tells the reader to not expect any more dictionaties.    ",
  "     2.2. So if i pick FLY from ACT, it'll be ACT_FLY!                                         ",
  "  3. Why is there a space sometimes in keys?                                                   ",
  "     3.1. It tells the compiler to not add underscore (_) to activity name.                    ",
  "     3.2. Example: ACT > DIE  > BACKWARD = ACT_DIEBACKWARD                                     ",
  "  4. Why is there a 0 in first value of array?                                                 ",
  "     4.1. It tells the reader to use the current path as an activity.                          ",
  "     4.2. Example: ACT > WALK > 0 = ACT_WALK                                                   ",

  "     5.2. So if there array with key '1', then the reader will just ignore it.                 ",
  "     5.3. That means you can make pseudo-comments here, like the one you're reading right now! ",
